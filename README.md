It is a 2D game about searching items, soving puzzles and overcoming obstacles. Game is inspired by small minigame in a game Creaks. Whole game is just a box of eight rooms, but they are different for each character. For gathering necessary informations you have to search the enviroments and have dialogs with other characters.
